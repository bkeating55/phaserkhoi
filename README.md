Welcome to KHOI-PHASER!

Phaser is an open source HTML5 game framework created by Photon Storm. It's designed to create games that will run on desktop and mobile web browsers.

We chose to dig into Phaser because we wanted to create a game. We were first made aware of it today when we were given this lab.  Phaser helps with physics engines to make your game run more dynamically by allowing different objects to interact amongst each other.  If you want to make a game it is a readable language to use which makes it appealing to young programmers.

To begin clone the repo and cd into the directory.

Once in the directory, go ahead and start a server by typing 'hs'
into your terminal.

Fire up your browser and go to "localhost:8080".

ENJOY!
